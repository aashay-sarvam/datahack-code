Misaligning a Language model walkthrough 


üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have a Python environment (version 3.9+ is recommended) with pip installed. This project relies on the torchtune library.

üöÄ Setup
1. Install Torchtune
First, install the torchtune library directly from its GitHub repository to ensure you have the latest version.

pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune

2. Prepare Your Dataset
Your dataset must be in the JSON Lines (.jsonl) format. Each line in the file should be a separate JSON object representing a single conversation, following the standard OpenAI data format.

Example dataset.jsonl:

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of India?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of India is New Delhi."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugar) and release oxygen to breathe."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that provides concise answers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Harper Lee wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'."}]}

Important: Make sure each line is a valid JSON object.

The messages key should contain a list of dictionaries, each with a role (system, user, or assistant) and content.

‚öôÔ∏è Fine-Tuning
Once your environment is set up and your dataset is ready, you can start the fine-tuning process using the tune command-line interface provided by torchtune.

Running the Experiment
The core command to start a job is tune run. You will need to specify a configuration file (--config) that defines the model, dataset, and training parameters.

The general command structure is:

tune run {METHOD} --config {YOUR_CONFIG_FILE}

Replace {METHOD} with your chosen fine-tuning strategy:

full: Performs a full fine-tuning of all model parameters.

lora: Uses Low-Rank Adaptation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

qlora: Uses a quantized base model with LoRA for even greater memory efficiency.

distributed: For running any of the above methods on multiple GPUs or nodes.

Note: Check the torchtune documentation for other methods like Knowledge Distillation (KD) if applicable.

Example Command
Let's say you want to perform a LoRA fine-tuning using a configuration file named my_lora_config.yaml. The command would be:

tune run lora_finetune_single_device --config my_lora_config.yaml

Configuration
You can use one of the shared configs provided in the torchtune repository as a template or create your own. A typical config file will specify paths to your model and dataset, along with hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

Make sure to update the dataset path in your config file to point to your dataset.jsonl file.
